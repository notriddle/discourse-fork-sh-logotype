fork.sh's theme component to add the site name next to the icon
===============================================================

* It respects the scroll-replacement within topics and PMs
* It uses no JavaScript, so it shouldn't make Discourse any slower or break on updates
* It also looks pretty good (IMO)
* It's actual text, instead of part of the image
* [Here's how to install it](https://meta.discourse.org/t/how-do-i-install-a-theme-or-theme-component/63682).
* You're supposed to add it as a child theme, and not make it "enabled by default" or "selectable by users". It's a theme component, not a whole theme.
