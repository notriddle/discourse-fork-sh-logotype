A Discourse theme component to add a logotype next to your site icon
====================================================================

* It can link anywhere, instead of having to go to the forum front page.
* It respects the scroll-replacement within topics and PMs.
* It uses no JavaScript, so it shouldn't make Discourse any slower or break on updates.
* It also looks pretty good (IMO).

[Here's how to install it](https://meta.discourse.org/t/how-do-i-install-a-theme-or-theme-component/63682).
